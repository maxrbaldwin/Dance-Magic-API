    <h2>Class Structure</h2>
    <ol>
      <li style="padding: 0px 0px 10px 0px;"><b>Warm-up:</b> The warm-up is very important to all students. They are used to warm up students body, muscles and mind. To prevent serious injury. Students are encouraged to take the warm-up portion of the class very seriously.</li>
      <li style="padding: 10px 0px;"><b>Across the floor:</b> This section of the class is still part of warm-up time. It is also used to teach students ways of using dance to travel across the floor. Students are taught different combinations of steps that will help them with the idea of traveling while dancing.</li>
      <li style="padding: 10px 0px;"><b>Dance Combinations:</b> At the end of the class students are given a group of steps put together by the teacher. For a few weeks these steps are used and more steps are added. Students are encouraged to practice these steps and small combinations.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The students are taught to train their minds as well as their bodies. No student will be asked to do anything they are not capable of or feel uncomfortable doing. Students should be encouraged to practice at home.</p>
